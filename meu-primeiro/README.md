# MeuPrimeiro

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.
This project was initially created with Angular 2.
To update to Angular 7 we created a new with Angular CLI and copy ./src directory from the original project.
After this we execute:
- npm install
- npm install @bootstrap (necessary delete 'ngx-bootstrap' references in code)

To the Angular 8 it was only necessary execute the commands:
- ng update @angular/core
- ng update @angular/cli@latest

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
